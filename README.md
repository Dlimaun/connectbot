# About this project
We will use ConnectBot, a opensource ssh client for android, to create a remote terminal for developers.

# What we need
  * An ssh server
  * Screen

# What will be changed

With one command we will start ssh and screen. Then send a command to android app or send the apk to the device.
So the user will be able to see the terminal for logs and a lot of things.
